# Delhi AQI analysis
This work is to predict PM2.5 levels in Delhi using a linear regression model trained on three years of climatic data. We fetch the data from [CPCB-AQI Fetcher](https://github.com/ananyasen7/cpcb-aqi).

Initial data analysis, including a correlation matrix, helps identify key variables like temperature, relative humidity, and an aggregated wind metric. These variables are then used to train and evaluate the model, with performance metrics like Mean Squared Error and RÂ² guiding iterative refinements.
